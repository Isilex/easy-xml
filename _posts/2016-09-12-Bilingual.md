              <h1>How-to edit a bilingual WebSite</h1> <p>Isilex is a system that is 100% based around XML databases and contains absolutely no SQL. Everything, including its web pages, is made up of XML databases.</p> <p>It is therefore based around a system of webpages that are stocked in XHTML format.&nbsp;On the left-hand side of the screen a menu appears. That provides a button where you can toggle between ‘site français’ and ‘English version’, and this automatically changes the menus and pages from one version to the other.</p> <p>You can easily edit a page by connecting the Isilex server as an ‘administrator’ (with the password ‘administrator’) and cliking on a small button which is only made available there to those who are members of the editorial team.</p> <p>

              </p> <h1>Create a new page</h1> <p>To create a new page, navigate to the menu “Param” in the second section and click on the button “New”.&nbsp;A special editor will appear with a fragment of XML. You simply have to give a name to each page that you create.</p> <p>&nbsp;<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://isilex.github.io/easy-xml/images/2017-06-16T08-50-23.50.14.png" width="514" height="188">
