              <h1>Edit XML Corpus</h1> 
              <p>Isilex is conceived as an editing tool for developing different kinds of online textual corpora. It is based on an editorial system which enables the editing of files for annotating the corpus. The annotation is undertaken on the basis of the field-name “orth”, and whenever Isilex finds a lemmatised form of “orth” in the corpus it automatically creates a hyperlink in the form of a note indicator.</p> <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.isilex.fr/static/images/upload/2017-06-16T09:10:39.11.32.png" alt="" width="900" height="506"> <p>It is extremely easy to navigate around the corpus by means of Isicorpus. Once the corpus has been loaded up, it is immediately searchable through the search engine, and the annotation system is automatically available.</p> <p>It is possible to edit the corpus either on line or by batch. You can also edit in pdfs, and make interventions in the database, either online or via Basex. It is also possible to modify the CSS [“Cascading Style Sheets”] online.</p> <h1>In order to edit the corpus</h1> <p>You can simply click directly in the text of the corpus, once it has been uploaded.</p> <p>There is an online menu which allows you to safeguard directly the edits that you have made, and to visualise the markup that has been integrated into it, or to consult the epub file online.</p> <p>

              <div> <div> <p>It is important to grasp the philosophy behind Isilex. It is based on an approach which is entirely noSQL and is integrated around XML. It has been conceived on the one hand as a means of integrating textual corpora, and on the other hand as a way of providing notes to the corpora, with all the results searchable by a semantic-led search-engine. The links are made through exploiting libraries in full-text X-Query for the lemmatisation, the indexation and the stemming.</p> <p>It therefore provides a software engine for automating the publication of textual data online. You can publish a text or corpus by uploading it, and then your team can work on the files, and both intersect.</p> <p>In its ‘Lite’ version, Isilex is oriented either to a corpus or to a lexicon. Linking the two is done as a development specific to a project [?]</p> <h1>The annotation files</h1> <p>The alphabetical list (at the top right-hand of the screen) in Isilex links to a collectonm of XML files in a TEI/dictionary format. When Isilex encounter a format for which there is a file, it automatically creates an annotation, an indication in the form of a hyperlink in the margin of the corpus in question.</p> <p>Isilex is thus a tool that is designed specifically for Web-based editions.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h1>Saisir une fiche dans Isilex</h1> <p>Creating a file in Isilex.&nbsp;There are two ways of creating files in Isilex&nbsp;: either by means of the input template, and through the XML editor.</p> <p>

                  </p> <p>To save a new entry in Isilex, first fill out the various fields in the input template. Then what happens is:<br clear="none">
                    <strong>- “Form”</strong> formats the information provided so that it is in recognisable forms of words, and then the “Orth” field allows Isilex to look for an orthographic form of that word, and the “Pron” field furnishes information on the pronunciation of that word.<br clear="none">-<strong>“GramGrp”</strong> brings together the information furnished in grammatical order.<br clear="none">- The “Gram” field provides grammatical information on that word.<br clear="none">- The “Etym” field provides etymological information about that word.<br clear="none">-The <strong>“Sense”</strong> field brings together the information concerning the meaning of that word, with the “Usg” field furnishing details on the usage of the word (for example “archaic”).<br clear="none">- The “Def” field furnishes a definition of the word.<br clear="none">- The “Note” field allows a commentary to be added.<br clear="none">- The <strong>“Cit”</strong> field brings together the oinformation relating to a citation of the word in the given source<br clear="none">- The “Quote” field allows one to indicate a quotation in which the word is found. The following field furnish details on the source of the quotation.<br clear="none">- The “Date” field indicates the dates of publication of the edition<br clear="none">- The “Title” field contains the title of the work in question<br clear="none">- The “Author” field contains the name of the author of the work in question<br clear="none">- The “Editor” field contains the name of the editor of the work in question.</p> <p>It is also possible for the compiler to add as many fields as s/he would like (for example, by adding two “Orth” fields) or by adding directly other field groups (within all the fields that are regrouped under “Form”, “GramGrp”, “Sense” or “Cit”).</p> </div> </div>

              <h1>The Eclipse Jetty Web Server</h1> <p>The Web Server for Iselex is a Java HTTP server and container, running the database engine BaseX. It is a web server based around the user conception called REST, invented by Roy Field in the 1990sw, and which allows one to associate a programming algorithm to a URL.</p> <p>When you access Isilex, it is ‘system ready’ on whatever platform you are using.</p> <p>You simply have to start it up. You will see a small ruler icon appear in the system tray adjacent to the time icon. Click on ‘open Isilex’ and it is then up and running. You can begin to work with it straight away, i.e. you can start creating files, annotations, and a corpus.</p> <p>Since it is programmed in Java, BaseX and its wrapper Web Isilex, work on any platform and do not need to be installed.</p> <p>
                <strong>How to Use Isilex as a Web Server&nbsp;</strong>
              </p> <p>By default, when the Eclipse Jetty Web Server it listens to TCP port 8984. To use Isilex as a Web Server, you need to reconfigure it to listen to TCP port 80 (the most frequently used TCP port). There are two ways of doing this:</p> <p>- The first is to reconfigure Eclipse Jetty as your principal server. In that case, you need to modify the servlet container in the Web.xml configuration file with a tet editor. Change the port to port 80 and restart Isilex, which will now listen to port 80.</p> <p>- The second is to be used if you are configured (and this often happens) to another more classic kind of Java HTTP server such as Apache or Nginx. In that case you have to instigate the redirection to p[ort 8984 within Apache or Nginx. You will find the instructions for how to do that for both Nginx and Apache virtual host systems here: <a shape="rect" href="https://www.ghostforbeginners.com/how-to-proxy-port-80-to-2368-for-ghost-with-nginx/">here (Nginx)</a> and <a shape="rect" href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/fr/vhosts/examples.html">there (Apache)</a>

                <strong>Adding Functionality</strong>
              </h1> <p>Isilex’s great strength is that it is a ready-to-use package. All the same, users who want to wor up their own particular applications to suit their research needs can do so very easily.</p> <p>At the base-level of Isielx there is a repertory called “Webapp” which contains a file entitled “Additional.xqm”. |You can easily add REST (representation state tranfer) functions here in order to implement your own efforts (to find out more on the Xquery syntax to be used in REST. Consult <a shape="rect" href="http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Repository">http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Repository</a>.</p> <p>Isilex puts its users in touch with a small collection of functionality from its own in-built library. What does this consist of? Here is an example:</p> <p>To create a page which says ‘”Hello World” you simply open the file “additional.xqm” (mentioned above), and add at the end of it the following lines of code:</p> <pre>1. declare %rest:path('/monAppli') <br clear="none">2. %output:method('xhtml') <br clear="none">3. function isilex:monAppli()<br clear="none">4. { <br clear="none">5. isi:template('Hello World') <br clear="none">6. }; </pre> <p>That is all that you need to do. Once you have saved that file, you can simply open your application at the address: http://localhost:8984/mon Appli and, as though by magic, the application launches.</p> <p>
                <strong>XQM?</strong>
              </p> <p>The development of new XQM functionality is well documented on the web. You will find a description of the format of the URL which are anticipated by BaseX available at:&nbsp;<a shape="rect" href="http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Repository">http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Repository</a>

              <h1>How-to edit a bilingual WebSite</h1> <p>Isilex is a system that is 100% based around XML databases and contains absolutely no SQL. Everything, including its web pages, is made up of XML databases.</p> <p>It is therefore based around a system of webpages that are stocked in XHTML format.&nbsp;On the left-hand side of the screen a menu appears. That provides a button where you can toggle between ‘site français’ and ‘English version’, and this automatically changes the menus and pages from one version to the other.</p> <p>You can easily edit a page by connecting the Isilex server as an ‘administrator’ (with the password ‘administrator’) and cliking on a small button which is only made available there to those who are members of the editorial team.</p> <p>
